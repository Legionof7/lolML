# lolML - a League of Legends Machine Learning Project
League of Legends is a popular online multiplayer game. During each game, teams farm for gold, fight each other, destroy towers, and kill dragons. Games end after one team destroys the other's nexus, or when one team surrenders. The purpose of this project is to predict the eventual winner of the game before the game ends.

The project is still in an exploratory phase. I made a [short blog post](http://www.trailofpapers.net/2015/10/playing-with-random-forests-in-league.html) highlighting some of the early findings.
