# lolML - a League of Legends Machine Learning Project
League of Legends is a popular online multiplayer game. During each game, teams farm for gold, fight each other, destroy towers, and kill dragons. Games end after one team destroys the other's nexus, or when one team surrenders. The purpose of this project is to predict the eventual winner of the game before the game ends.

The project is currently in an exploratory phase, where I am defining new features, and getting more data.
